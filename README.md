# Frontend Mentor - Project tracking intro component

![Design preview for the Project tracking intro component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out.

This was a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge and it was fun trying to get this done with Pure CSS. Tried to avoid using Tachyons library which can sometimes be frustrating!

Going forward,  I would be only be taking on JS related challenges. ðŸš€
